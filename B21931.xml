            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>The King to the Justices of His Bench sendeth greeting: Whereas of late before certaine Persons deputed to treat upon sundry debates, had betweene Us, and certain great men of Our Realm, Amongst other things it was accorded, That in Our next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after provision shall he made by Us, and the common Assent of the Prelates, Earles, and Barons, that in all Parliaments, Treaties, and other Assemblies which should be made in the Realm of England for ever, That every man shall come without all force and Armour, well and peaceably to the Honour of Us, and the peace of Us and Our Realm. And now in our next Parliament at Westminster, after the said Treaties, the Prelates, Earles, Barons, and the Commonalty of our Realm there assembled, to take advice of this busines, have said, That to Us it belongeth, and Our part is through Our Royall Seigniory straightly to defend force of Armour, and all other force against Our Peace at all times when it shal please Us, and to punish them which shall do contrary according to Our Lawes and Usages of Our Realme.</p>
                        <p>And hereunto they are bound to aide us, as their Soveraigne Lord at all seasons, when need shall be. We command you, that you cause these things to be read afore you in the said Bench, and there to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled.</p>

            </q>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:197097:3"/>
            <p> THe occasion of this Declaration was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of Armed men from coming to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to distrub the Peace of it, and is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly alledged for the maintenance of such Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, as we are now raised against the Parliament. The title of the Statute being thus, To all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Treaties, every man shall come without Force and Armes. So that the Question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it belong to the King or no to restrain such force; But if the King shall refuse to discharge that Duty and Trust, Whether there is not a power in the two Houses, to provide for the safety of the Parliament, and Peace of the kingdome, which is the end, for which the Ordinance concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> was made and being agreeable to the scope and purpose of the Law, cannot in Reason be adjudged to be contrary to it; For although the Law do affime it to be in the King, yet doth not exclude those, in whom the Law hath placed a power for that purpose; As in the Courts of Justice, the Sheriffs, and other Officers and Ministers of those Courts. And as their power is derived from the King by His Patents, yet cannot it be restrained by His Majesties command, by His great Seal, or otherwise, much lesse can the power of Parliament be concluded by His Majesties command, because the Authority thereof is of a higher, and more eminent nature, than any of those Courts.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged, That the King is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Justice, and Protection; But the Acts of Justice, and Protection, are not exercised in His own
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:197097:4"/> Person, nor depend upon His pleasure, but by His Courts, and by His Ministers, who must do their Duty therein, though the King in his own Person should forbid them; And therefore, If Judgements should be given by them against the Kings Will and Personall command, yet are they the Kings Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The High Court of Parliament, is not onely a Court of Judicature, enabled by the Laws, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge, and determine the Rights, and Liberties of the Kingdom, against such Patents, and Grants of His Majesty, as are prejudiciall thereunto; although strengthened by His Personall Command, and by His Proclamation, under the great Seale: But it is likewise a Councell to provide for the necessities, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the imminent dangers; and preserve the publike Peace and safety of the Kingdome, and to declare the Kings pleasure in those things as are requisite thereunto; and what they do herein, hath the Stamp of Royall Authority, although His Majesty seduced by evill Counsell, doe in His own Person, oppose, or interrupt the same. For the Kings Supream Power, and Royall Pleasure, is exercised and declared in this High Court of Law, and Councell, after a more eminent and obligatory manner, then it can be by any personall Act or Resolution of His Own.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the Lords and Commons, which are His Majesties great and Highest Councell, have ordained, That for the present and necessary Defence of the Realme, the Trained Bands, and <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdome should be ordered according to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197097:4"/> and all his Majesties loving Subjects, as well by that Law as by other Lawes, are bound to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient thereunto, and what they do therein is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Law to be interpreted to be done in ayd of the King, in discharge of that Trust which he is tied to performe: and it is so farre from being liable to punishment, that if they should refuse to do it, or be perswaded by any Commission or Command of his Majesty to do the contrary, they might justly be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for the same, according to the Lawes and Usages of the Realme: for the King, by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, is not enabled to destroy his people, but to protect and defend them; and the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and all other his Majesties Officers, and Ministers, ought to be subservient to that Power and Authority, which the Law hath placed in his Majesty to that purpose, though he himself in his own person should neglect the same.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the Lords and Commons do declare the said Proclamation to be voyd in Law, and of none effect, For that by the Constitution and Policy of this Kingdom, the King by his Proclamation cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Law contrary to the Judgment and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of any of the inferiour Courts of Justice, much lesse against the High Court of Parliament; for if it were admitted, that the King by his Proclamation may declare a Law, thereby his Proclamations will in effect become Lawes, which would turn to the subverting of the Law of the Land, and the Rights, and Liberties of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>And the Lords and Commons do require and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197097:5"/> all Constables, Petty-Constables, and all other his Majesties Officers, and Subjects whatsoever, to Muster, Levie, raise, March and Exercise, or to Summon or Warne any upon Warrant from the Lievtenants, Deputy-Lievtenants, or other Officers of the Trained Bands, and all others according to the said Ordinance of both Houses; and shall not presume to Muster, Levie, Raise, March, or Exercise, by vertue of any Commission, or other Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, as they will answer the contrary at their perils; and in their so doing, they do further declare, That they shall be protected by the Power and Authority of both Houses of Parliament; And that whosoever shall oppose, question, or hinder them in the execution of the said Ordinance, shall be proceeded against as violaters of the Laws, and distubers of the peace of Kingdom.</p>
